<h1>Vacation Ideas</h1>

<p class=bodytext>Here I have some of my favorite ideas for vacations, and some pictures from my favorite ones I would go on again.</p>

<h2>Past Vacations</h2>

<h3>Lava Hot Springs Camping Trip</h3>

<p>This trip was 5 days. One day was for the hot pots, one for the river rafting, one for the waterpark, and the other two days for traveling. We took 7 people and drove out to Lava Hot Springs from Layton, Utah. The trip cost in it's entirety just under $700. </p>

<h3>Hollywood/Anaheim, California and Las Vegas</h3>

<p>This trip was a 10 day vacation that we planned out with six people (which are my family and I in the photo above). We drove from Layton to Los Angeles the first night stopping in Las Vegas for a break. The first night was just getting into our hotel and unpacking for the night. We went to Disneyland for days 2, 3, and 4. Followed by Universal Studios Hollywood the next two days. We went to Las Vegas for the last three on our way home. In total for the 6 of us for a 10 day vacation it cost a total of 6000. We all loved the vacation and are planning on going back soon. </p>

<h2>Future Vacations</h2>

<h3>Iceland</h3>

<p>I want to visit Iceland at sometime before I kick the bucket. Between the views, and culture of Iceland, it is obvious that it would be a top destination for anyone. Some of the things I want to visit include the fjords, the ice caps, and the blue lagoon. The two cities I would want to visit for sure would be Reykjavik and Akureyri. I think the best thing when visiting Iceland would be being able to camp and see the night sky and the northern lights.</p>

<p> Another dream vacation destination for me would be Japan. I would love to visit Okinawa, Kyoto, and Tokyo. I would love to visit some of the following places on my vacation: </p>

<ul>
	<li>Mt. Fuji</li>
	<li>Religious Temples</li>
	<li>Street Vendors</li>
	<li>Cherry Blossom</li>
</ul>
